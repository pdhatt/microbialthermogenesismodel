# microbialthermogenesismodel

This is the github repository for the Microbial Thermogenesis Model. The code was verified to work with MATLAB version R2022a and MATLAB Online as of August 14, 2023 

The code is annotated with comments for what each step of the code is conducting. 

There are 4 files, one for each strain (ArcB, GlnL, YccC, and wild-type) tested in the original publication.

Originally developed by Puneet Dhatt and Tae Seok Moon

All assumptions of the model and model development steps are included in the original publication's method section.
