# microbialthermogenesismodel

This is the GitHub repository for the Microbial Thermogenesis Model. The code was verified to work with MATLAB version R2022a and MATLAB Online as of August 2023.

The code is annotated with comments for what each step of the code is conducting. 

The model background and assumptions are explained in the publication cited below.

There are 5 files, one for each strain (ArcB, GlnL, YccC, wild-type, and glnL overexpression) as developed in the original publication. Running the code will give you the plots for the model figures in the paper (Figure 5).

Originally developed by Puneet Dhatt and Tae Seok Moon

All assumptions of the model and model development steps are included in the original publication's method section.
